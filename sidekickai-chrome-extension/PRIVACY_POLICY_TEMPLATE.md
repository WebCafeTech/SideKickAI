# SidekickAI Privacy Policy

**Last Updated**: [INSERT DATE]

## Introduction

SidekickAI ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our browser extension.

## Data Collection and Storage

### Local Storage Only

SidekickAI is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **API Keys**: All API keys (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Hugging Face) are stored **locally** on your device using Chrome's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`). These keys are:
  - Never transmitted to our servers
  - Never shared with third parties (except the AI provider you choose)
  - Only accessible by the extension on your device

- **User Preferences**: Theme selections, model preferences, and other settings are stored locally on your device.

### No Data Collection

We do **NOT** collect, store, or transmit:
- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ Chat messages or conversations
- ❌ Screenshots (except when you explicitly send them to an AI provider)
- ❌ Analytics or usage data
- ❌ Any other user data

## Third-Party Services

SidekickAI integrates with the following third-party AI services:

### OpenAI
- **Service**: OpenAI API (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, etc.)
- **Data Sent**: Your chat messages and screenshots (when you choose OpenAI)
- **Privacy Policy**: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy
- **Your API Key**: Stored locally, sent only to OpenAI API

### Google Gemini
- **Service**: Google Gemini API

## How We Use Your Data

Since we don't collect data, there's nothing to use. All processing happens:
- **Locally** on your device, or
- **Directly** with the AI provider you choose (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)

## Data Security

- All API keys are stored using Chrome's secure local storage
- No data is transmitted to our servers (we don't have servers)
- All communication with AI providers uses HTTPS encryption
- Your data never leaves your device except when you explicitly send it to an AI provider

## Children's Privacy

SidekickAI is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

## Your Rights
